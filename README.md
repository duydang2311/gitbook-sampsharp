# Introduction

This documentation is written based on my knowledge and experience while working with [SampSharp](https://sampsharp.net/). Hopefully this would help you get started with the framework easier.

## What is SampSharp?

In case you visit this site by accident and don't know what [SampSharp](https://sampsharp.net/) is, here's a brief summary by Tim Potze (the author):

> SampSharp is a framework for writing game modes for SA-MP in C#.&#x20;

## Choose a SampSharp framework to work with

SampSharp provides 2 frameworks for SA:MP development: GameMode and ECS (Entity-Component-System).

SampSharp.GameMode is the most mature one and has much better developer documentation on [SampSharp official website](https://sampsharp.net/).

ECS - SampSharp.Entities is a newer framework that applies [Entity-Component-System pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity\_component\_system), hence lacking of proper documentation for developers.

Since the ECS one is the only framework I'm experienced with, I'll be only sharing my knowledge about ECS here.
